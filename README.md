## 📄 Project Overview

This virtual lab project demonstrates how to design and analyze the frequency response curve of a first-order active Butterworth low pass filter using **IC 741**. The goal is to help students visualize the working of analog filters interactively through a browser-based platform.

### Key Objectives:
- Design a Low Pass Filter using op-amp IC 741.
- Understand the roles of resistors, capacitors, and op-amps in frequency filtering.
- Analyze the frequency response curve and voltage gain behavior.
- Provide interactive simulation and learning content.
